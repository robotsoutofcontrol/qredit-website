									<h4>Comments</h4>
									<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the
										comments form, and
										also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam
										detection.<br>
										An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be
										provided to
										the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy
										policy is
										available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment,
										your
										profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
									<br>

									<h4>Media</h4>
									<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with
										embedded location
										data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any
										location data
										from images on the website.</p>
									<br>
									<p>First and last name</p>
									<p>E-mail address</p>
									<p>IP Address</p><br>

									<h4>Contact forms</h4>

									<p>Qredit processes your personal data because you use our services and / or because
										you provide
										them yourself. Below is an overview of the personal data we process:</p>

									<br>
									<h4>Cookies</h4>

									<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email
										address and
										website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to
										fill in your
										details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one
										year.

										If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary
										cookie to
										determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data
										and is
										discarded when you close your browser.

										When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login
										information and your
										screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options
										cookies last for
										a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If
										you log out
										of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

										If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your
										browser. This
										cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article
										you just
										edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
									<br>
									<h4>Embedded content from other websites</h4><br>

									<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
										articles, etc.).
										Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the
										visitor has
										visited the other website.

										These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
										third-party
										tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including
										tracking your
										interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in
										to that
										website.</p><br>
									<h4>How long we retain your data</h4>

									<br>
									<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely.
										This is so we
										can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of
										holding them in a
										moderation queue.

										For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal
										information they
										provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal
										information
										at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators
										can also see
										and edit that information.</p><br>

									<h4>What rights you have over your data</h4>

									<br>
									<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to
										receive an
										exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you
										have provided
										to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.
										This does not
										include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security
										purposes.</p>
									<br>


									<h4>Where we send your data</h4>

									<br>
									<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
